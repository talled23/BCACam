# BCACam
My Computer Science 2020-2021 Midyear project. "A tool that uses your webcam and monitors/tells you to correct your posture. It will also have cool filters that will show up in your Zoom video. Finally, there will be hand gestures that allow you to control your Zoom through keyboard shortcuts."

# Requirements
BCA Cam requires `python>=3.6`. Other dependencies are found in `requirements.txt`. [`OBS-VirtualCam`](https://github.com/CatxFish/obs-virtual-cam/releases) is an external dependency needed to integrate BCA Cam with Zoom.
